# HR Companion (TalentScout AI)

A Streamlit‑based RAG (Retrieval‑Augmented Generation) application that extracts structured data from PDF resumes, stores embeddings in Supabase, and provides AI‑powered candidate ranking and chat‑based HR assistance.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Resume Ingestion** – Upload PDFs, extract text with `pypdf`, parse key fields (name, email, experience, skills, summary) using a LLM.
- **Vector Search** – Store embeddings in Supabase and perform semantic matching against a job description.
- **SQL‑Based Look‑ups** – List or filter candidates directly from the database (e.g., "show all candidates", "who has >5 years experience").
- **HR Chat Assistant** – Ask natural‑language questions about the talent pool; the assistant builds a context from the database and answers based on real data.
- **Live UI** – Streamlit tabs for uploading, ranking, and chatting, with a data‑frame view of the current talent pool.
